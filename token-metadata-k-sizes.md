# Token metadata circuit K sizes: Compact and MinoCrab

This is a measured comparison of five equivalent token-metadata circuits. It targets the byte-heavy paths in `MetadataProbe` and uses generated `SSTAR.publishMetadata` as the deployed fixed-literal control. It does not replace any Stagenet artifact, address, verifier, or transaction recorded in the [deployment record](stagenet-token-metadata-deployments.md).

## Results

Compact-v3 and MinoCrab-v3 were measured with the same Compact 0.34.0 bundled `/opt/compactc/zkir-v3 mock-compile` oracle. Compact-v2 is the historical source baseline and was measured separately with that image's bundled v2 oracle.

| Contract and circuit | Compact-v2 | Compact-v3 | MinoCrab-v3 | MinoCrab-v3 vs Compact-v3 |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| `MetadataProbe.publishRaw` | k19 / 328,671 rows | k17 / 74,247 rows | **k11 / 1,897 rows** | **−72,350 rows (−97.45%); k −6** |
| `MetadataProbe.publishStandard` | k19 / 417,350 rows | k17 / 88,654 rows | **k12 / 3,898 rows** | **−84,756 rows (−95.60%); k −5** |
| `MetadataProbe.publishFixture` | k7 / 23 rows | k7 / 103 rows | k7 / 103 rows | 0 rows; k unchanged |
| `MetadataProbe.calls` | k5 / 24 rows | k6 / 34 rows | k6 / 34 rows | 0 rows; k unchanged |
| `SSTAR.publishMetadata` | k7 / 28 rows | k7 / 120 rows | k7 / 120 rows | 0 rows; k unchanged |

The reduction belongs to the two runtime byte-serialization circuits. The literal publishers and counter getter are controls: MinoCrab matches the Compact-v3 K and row counts exactly. The table does not imply whole-contract savings. No proving time, proving-key bytes, verifier-key bytes, or deployment cost was measured.

K and rows are the backend oracle's reported values. They were not derived by rounding rows to a power of two. The MinoCrab model independently returned the same five MinoCrab-v3 K/row pairs.

## What was held equal

The Rust port preserves the original input order and widths, disclosures, ledger field positions, event order, 256-byte payload, 288-byte `Misc` envelope, counter effects, and SSTAR one-time publication guard. In particular:

- `publishRaw` continues to accept every `Uint<8>` kind and length, including reserved kind `0x80` and lengths `191` and `255`.
- `publishStandard` keeps kind, both lengths, and decimals as unrestricted circuit-level `Uint<8>` values. Consumer-level limits in comments were not added as circuit checks.
- `MetadataProbe._calls` remains Counter field 0.
- `SSTAR._published` remains Boolean cell 0, `_mints` remains Counter field 1, and publication changes only `_published`.
- Every event is the 32-byte NUL-padded name `TokenMetadata` followed by the exact 256-byte standard payload. Trailing NUL bytes are part of the checked envelope.

The focused Docker suite has 11 test functions. Shared preimages cover four raw cases and three standard cases, including 0/255 bytes, 31-byte limb boundaries, lengths 0/190/191/255, reserved and maximum kind bytes, and full name/symbol widths. Positive cases also cover the fixed fixture, counter getter, and SSTAR publisher. `assert_call_compatible` compares typed input/output schemas and public-input vectors and requires both MinoCrab's simulator and Midnight's upstream `IrSource::check` to accept both artifacts.

Tamper tests change one event payload, remove the counter effect, change SSTAR's published read, change only SSTAR's state write, or supply an out-of-range `Uint<8>`. Both the Compact-v3 and MinoCrab-v3 artifacts are required to fail in the simulator and in the upstream VM check. This is strong differential evidence over the checked cases, not a formal equivalence proof or a compiler audit.

## Reproduce

The focused benchmark is documented in [`benchmark/README.md`](benchmark/README.md). With Docker running on aarch64:

```bash
./benchmark/scripts/reproduce.sh
```

The script first creates a temporary Compact container from the pinned official release URL and checksum. It then compiles both Compact versions without keys, runs the differential suite, emits MinoCrab ZKIR, measures every artifact with the appropriate bundled oracle, runs the independent model cross-check, prints hashes, and removes its temporary image and Docker cache volumes. A prebuilt compatible image can be supplied through `COMPACT_IMAGE`. Captured command and result excerpts from the measured run are in [`benchmark/results/oracle.log`](benchmark/results/oracle.log); the complete structured result set is in [`benchmark/results/measurements.json`](benchmark/results/measurements.json).
